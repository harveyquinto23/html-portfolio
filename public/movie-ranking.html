<h1>The Best Movies According to Harvey</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar is my favorite movie because it combines space exploration, 
    advanced technology, and a deep, thought-provoking story. 
    I love films that explore the mysteries of the universe 
    and the possibility of traveling to different planets, 
    and Interstellar does this in such a captivating way. 
    The blend of scientific concepts with emotional depth 
    makes it an unforgettable experience every time I watch it.</p>
<h3>Star Trek</h3>
<p>I really enjoy Star Trek because it presents an inspiring vision of the 
    future where diverse cultures and species work together 
    to explore the universe. The series is more than just a 
    space adventure; it delves into complex moral and ethical 
    questions, making it thought-provoking as well as entertaining.
    
<p>I love the idea of venturing into uncharted territories, 
    encountering new civilizations, and the way Star Trek focuses 
    on diplomacy and understanding rather than conflict. Each episode 
    brings something new, whether it’s a scientific concept, a challenge 
    to overcome, or a powerful message about humanity. It’s a perfect mix 
    of exploration, technology, and meaningful storytelling, which is exactly 
    what I look for in a sci-fi series.</p>

<h3>Geostorm</h3>
<p>I find Geostorm fascinating because it explores the power and 
    unpredictability of nature through a high-stakes sci-fi thriller. 
    The movie’s concept of controlling the weather to prevent natural disasters 
    is both exciting and terrifying, especially as we face real-life climate 
    challenges today.
<p>I love how the story combines advanced technology, 
    suspense, and action, showing what might happen if we tried to control 
    something as immense as the Earth’s climate. The visuals of 
    intense storms and natural disasters are gripping, and 
    the plot keeps me on the edge of my seat. Geostorm is both an 
    exhilarating ride and a reminder of how powerful and unpredictable 
    nature can be.</p>
