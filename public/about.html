<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm <b>Franz Harvey Quinto</b>, an IT professional and educator passionate about technology and continuous learning. 
  I hail from the scenic province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and hold a bachelor’s 
  degree in Information Technology, with a specialization in Network Administration.</p>

<p>Since embarking on my teaching career in 2019, I've had the privilege of sharing knowledge across diverse disciplines.
  I spent five fulfilling years at a private higher education institution in Nueva Ecija, 
  where I primarily taught ICT courses to maritime students, IT courses to Information Systems students, 
  and ICT to senior high school learners. Additionally, I served as a Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) 
  certification trainer, helping students achieve globally recognized credentials.</p>
  In August 2024, I joined PHINMA-Araullo University in Cabanatuan City, where I currently teach Information Technology students. While I deeply enjoy shaping young minds and preparing them for IT careers, my passion for learning has led me to revisit an area of technology that I left unexplored during my college years: web development.
  
<p>Back in college, I chose to specialize in network administration over web development. 
  However, as the tech landscape evolves, so does my curiosity. To pursue this interest, I recently 
  enrolled in a full-stack web development course on Udemy. This self-paced journey is helping me explore the intricacies of web development, from front-end design to back-end integration. My goal is to transition into a career as a web developer, 
  creating dynamic and user-friendly websites and applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
  
<p>Beyond teaching and studying, I value self-improvement and growth. I strive to maintain a 
  balance between mentoring others and learning new skills to stay relevant in the 
  ever-changing tech industry.</p>
  
<p>I’m excited about the future and look forward to the opportunities that 
  lie ahead in both education and web development. 
  Whether I’m in a classroom or coding a new project, 
  I’m driven by a single purpose: to inspire innovation and empower others through technology.</p>
